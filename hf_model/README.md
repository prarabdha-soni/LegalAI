## Model Description

Dolphin (**Do**cument Image **P**arsing via **H**eterogeneous Anchor Prompt**in**g) is a novel multimodal document image parsing model that follows an analyze-then-parse paradigm. It addresses the challenges of complex document understanding through a two-stage approach designed to handle intertwined elements such as text paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables.

## üìë Overview

Document image parsing is challenging due to its complexly intertwined elements such as text paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Dolphin addresses these challenges through a two-stage approach:

1. **üîç Stage 1**: Comprehensive page-level layout analysis by generating element sequence in natural reading order
2. **üß© Stage 2**: Efficient parallel parsing of document elements using heterogeneous anchors and task-specific prompts

Dolphin achieves promising performance across diverse page-level and element-level parsing tasks while ensuring superior efficiency through its lightweight architecture and parallel parsing mechanism.

## Model Architecture

Dolphin is built on a vision-encoder-decoder architecture using transformers:

- **Vision Encoder**: Based on Swin Transformer for extracting visual features from document images
- **Text Decoder**: Based on MBart for decoding text from visual features
- **Prompt-based interface**: Uses natural language prompts to control parsing tasks

The model is implemented as a Hugging Face `VisionEncoderDecoderModel` for easy integration with the Transformers ecosystem.

## Usage

Our demo will be released in these days. Please keep tuned! üî•

Please refer to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bytedance/Dolphin) for detailed usage.

- [Page-wise parsing](https://github.com/bytedance/Dolphin/demo_page_hf.py): for an entire document image
- [Element-wise parsing](https://github.com/bytedance/Dolphin/demo_element_hf.py): for an element (paragraph, table, formula) image
